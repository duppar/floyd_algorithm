# floyd_algorithm

# Description
A program implementing the Floyd-Warshall algorithm for computing the quickest route between any two given vertices
This project uses the Floyd-Warshall algorithm to find the shortest path between two vertices in a weighted graph using Python. 
# Prerequisites
requirements.txt file for required imports
# Getting Started
The main function in the program is:
find_shortest_path(
    source_node: int,
    destination_node: int,
    interim_node: int,
    path_length: list,
    number_of_nodes: int,
) -> list:


The function takes several parameters. 
path_length = [[0, 10, 15, 3], [99999, 0, 5, 12], [99999, 99999, 0, 7], [99999, 99999, 99999, 0]]
print(shortestPath(nodes, weights, 1, 2)) #print quickest path between from 1 to 2 for graph 1


# Outputs:

##Graphs The following graphs are included and used in the unit test.
